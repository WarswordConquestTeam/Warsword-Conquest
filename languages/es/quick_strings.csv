qstr_When_enabled_this_ca|When enabled, this causes horses to travel slower as they take damage.
qstr_Ticked_autocalculate|Ticked, autocalculated battles also understand magic and cleric casters. Unticked, as in Native and auto-battles are only based on party size and troop levels.
qstr_Allows_exiled_lords_|Allows exiled lords to be pardoned after a time and rejoin a faction to prevent 'lord-drain' in the late game. ^^Must Enable to avoid problems
qstr_Low:^^___Center_poin|Low:^^ - Center points for fief allocation are calculated (villages 1 / castles 2 / towns 3) instead of (villages 1 / castles 1 / towns 2).^^ - For qst rescue prisoner and qst offer gift, the relatives that can be a target of the quest have been extended to include uncles and aunts and in-laws.^^ - Alterations to script calculate troop score for center (these changes currently are only relevant during claimant quests).^^ - When picking a new faction, lords are more likely to return to their original faction (except when that's the faction they're being exiled from), if the ordinary conditions for rejoining are met.  A lord's decision may also be influenced by his relations with other lords in the various factions, instead of just his relations with the faction leaders.^^Medium:^^ - Some changes for lord relation gains/losses when fiefs are allocated.^^ - Kings overrule lords slightly less frequently on faction issues.^^ - In deciding who to support for a fief, minor parameter changes for certain personalities. Some lords will still give priority to fiefless lords or to the lord who conquered the center if they have a slightly negative relation (normally the cutoff is 0 for all personalities).^^ - When a lord can't find any good candidates for a fief under the normal rules, instead of automatically supporting himself he uses a weighted scoring scheme.^^ - In various places where 'average renown * 3/2' appears, an alternate calculation is sometimes used.^^High:^^ - The 'renown factor' when an NPC lord or the player courts and NPC lady is adjusted by the prestige of the lady's guardian.^^ - When a faction has fiefless lords and no free fiefs left, under some circumstances the king will redistribute a village he owns.^^
qstr_Low:^^___Caravan_tra|Low:^^ - Caravan trade benefits both the source and the destination^^ - When the player surrenders, there is a chance his personal equipment will not be looted, based on who accepted the surrender and the difficulty setting. (This is meant to address a gameplay issue. In the first 700 days or so, there is no possible benefit to surrendering rather than fighting to the last man.) Also, a bug that made it possible for books etc. to be looted was corrected.^^ - AI caravans take into consideration distance when choosing their next destination and will be slightly more like to visit their own faction. This strategy is mixed with the Native one, so the trade pattern will differ but not wildly.^^ - Scale town merchant gold by prosperity (up to a maximum 40% change).^^ - Food prices increase in towns that have been under siege for at least 48 hours.^^ - In towns the trade penalty script has been tweaked to make it more efficient to sell goods to merchants specializing in them.^^Medium:^^ - Food consumption increases in towns as prosperity increases.^^   Consumption also increases with garrison sizes.^^ - Lords' looting skill affects how much gold they take from the player when they defeat him.^^ - Lords' leadership skill modifies their troop wage costs the same way it does for the player.^^ - The player can lose gold when his fiefs are looted, like lords.^^ - The same way that lord party sizes increase as the player progresses, mercenary party sizes also increase to maintain their relevance. (The rate is the same as for lords: a 1.25% increase per level.)^^ - If the player has a kingdom of his own, his spouse will receive part of the bonus that ordinarily would be due a liege.  The extent of this bonus depends on the number of fiefs the players holds. This bonus is non-cumulative with the marshall bonus.^^ - Attrition is inflicted on NPC-owned centers if they can't pay wages, but only above a certain threshold.^^ - Strangers cannot acquire enterprises (enforced at 1 instead of at 0, so you have to do something).^^High: - The total amount of weekly bonus gold awarded to kings in Calradia   remains constant: as kings go into exile, their bonuses are divided among the remaining kings.^^ - If lord's run a personal gold surplus after party wages, the extra is divided among the lord and his garrisons budgets (each castle and town has its own pool of funds to pay for soldiers) on the basis of whether the lord is low on gold or any of his fortresses are. (If none are low   on gold, the lord takes everything, like before.)^^ - The honor loss from an offense depends in part on the player's honor   at the time.  The purer the reputation, the greater the effect of a single disagrace.^^ - Raiding change: village gold lost is removed from uncollected taxes before the balance (if any) is removed from the lord.^^ - Cash for prisoners

qstr_You_were_born_as_a_c|You were born as a citizen of the Empire under the rule of Karl Franz.^The Empire is a large country with many provinces containing large, wealthy cities. Technological and military advancement is key to Imperial philosophy. Your time has come to make the journey too.
qstr_You_were_born_in_the|You were born in the great Kingdom of Bretonnia.^ A kingdom famed for it's gallant fully armoured knights and feudal Lords who fight for their King Louen Leoncoeur. Chivalry and honour mix with poverty and inequality in this great land west of the Grey mountains.
qstr_You_were_born_in_the_|You were born in the rich and desertous land of Araby,^one of the main intellectual and cultural hubs in the world. You grew up in the shadow of the Tomb Kings^and the hatred of the dead and you learnt from a young age that sometimes the sword is the only way to have peace.
qstr_You_were_born_in_the_s|You were born in the snowy Tsardom of Kislev. The front line of civilisation against the terrible threat of the north. Life is hard and so are the people of Kislev who fight the realm of chaos and the northern trolls on a daily basis. Famed for their winged charges and disciplined archers the armies of Kislev will stand unflinching against all those who try and claim the land that is theirs by right.
qstr_You_were_born_in_the_l|You were born in the land of the rising sun, far to the east but a great natural disaster has forced the Shogun to find a new land so that his many displaced citizens can have a place to call home. You follow the Shogun's army on their journey.
qstr_You_were_born_in_the_B|You were born in the Brotherhood of Pirates. They have no set borders but rather^whatever land they can take for themselves. The pirates follow the code with each other but concerning others they^lie, cheat and steal whatever they can. Hated by all the pirates have to be calculated and clinical in their endeavours^and as a consequence have some of the smartest and most charismatic leaders in the World. Time for you to take your fill.
qstr_Your_father_was_a_br|Your father was a bray shaman, a beast embodied with the magic of the dark Gods. Sacred, feared, untouchable, your father would counsel the beastlords before their great campaigns on how best to destroy the race of men and what rituals should be carried out the night before. On the occassions he fought with the army all foes trembled and fell before his fell sorcery.
qstr_Men_believe_that_the|Men believe that the beastmen are lower than Orcs when it comes to sophistication of their battle strategy and in the heat of an enraged battle they may be right but beforehand the hordes like to gain as much of an advantage as they can. The favourite tactic of the beastmen is an ambush in the forest and this was one area your father was a master of, especially with a smaller scale force of under 50 troops. He was the bane of Imperial scout parties and patrols.
qstr_Your_father_was_a_fe|Your father was a ferocious bestigor and one of his beastlord's finest personal retainers. His horns were almost as long as the beastlord's and he had captured more enemy banners than any other beast in the Horde. He met his end prematurely when he decided it was his time to take leadership of the horde and challenged his lord to single combat. His severed head was kept as a reminder to all else who might have such ambitions.
qstr_Your_father_had_the_|Your father had the challenging task of gathering chaos warhounds and keeping them in line until they were needed to hunt down intruders, escaped prisoners or small groups of travellers. It takes a strong gor to be able to control these destructive creatures and many get torn apart on the job. Your father maintained authority at all times and trained them to hunt down their prey with a 100% success rate earning him the name of huntmaster.
qstr_You_seldom_see_the_g|You seldom see the great tuskgor chariots any more since the magic of the bray allowed them to be ridden by the horde but before the breakthrough was made the chariot was the most effective way of getting them into combat. Your father rode these great contraptions at full force towards enemy lines, no matter what stood in his way, and all you would see from further back was bodies being thrown in the air from one of the most devastating impacts you could see on a battlefield.
qstr_Your_father_was_the_|Your father was the warlord of a large herd who constantly harried the Empire and were always one of the first^to answer the the call to gathering. He was a nearly 7 foot tall and as strong as a bull, wielding his trusted axe he could cut a man in half with 1 swing. He took great pride in^his tuskgor chariot and taught you to ride as soon as you could walk.
qstr_Your_father_ran_the_|Your father ran the local Inn which was situated by the main pier of the river which serves the town. It was mainly used as a local drinking hole, the moot does not get many visitors from foreign lands but when they came they always found their way to your father's Inn and they always had a memorable night.
qstr_A_couple_of_decades_|A couple of decades ago the Halflings faced a lot of discrimination in foreign lands, even in the Empire who have the closest ties with them. In response the Halflings set up the Quinsberry Lodge which fights for Halfling rights in every Imperial city. Your father was a councillor who specialised in trading laws and trading rights for all the Empire's Halfling merchants.
qstr_Halflings_have_a_ver|Halflings have a very soft stance on the rights of property and generally if something is desired then it should be no bother to take it without asking because after all, why go to the trouble of asking when the answer was bound to be yes. Sometimes desirable items are kept in very inconvenient places such as safes and chests or even tucked away in an inside pocket and your father was a master of acquiring these items quickly and discretely. From the planning stage to the execution his skills were second to none and he taught you a thing or two before you left home.
qstr_Halflings_are_not_ve|Halflings are not very warlike in general but they can defend their homes very effectively if the need arises and the real strength of the halfling forces are their archers. Their keen eyesight and steady hands have led to their best archers being considered equals of the elite wood elf waywatchers and the Empire will pay a mighty sum to hire out units of halfling rangers during the larger campaigns. Your father was a ranger from the age of 17 until his death at the hands of a squig who ate him whole in the middle of a battle.
qstr_Your_father_was_a_lo|Your father was a local sheriff who was charged with keeping order and making sure that life in the moot went on in a just and fair manner. Of course if some gold coins or shiny objects happen to make their way into your fathers possession then the concept of fair can be up for interpretation.
qstr_Your_father_was_neve|Your father was never satisfied with life in the moot and wanted to join one of the Empires dungeoneer guilds. He was a gunslinger who loved his dual pistols which he could whip out of his coat and fire in a fraction of a second. He played a support role in his team but after a few years he was the considered the most valuable member of the party.
qstr_Attracted_by_the_leg|Attracted by the legends revolving around the many ruins lying in the depth of the gloomy woods, and their fabled tresures, your father came to Sylvania in search of the thrill of adventure and immense wealth. But soon he found that those decrepit walls weren't as deserted as many thought. At one point, tired of that risky life, he settled down in a small village, and after some time you were born.
qstr_Shunned_by_society_f|Shunned by society for his unorthodox preachings, your father fled to Sylvania in search of a safe place where to hide from the eyes of the imperial inquisitors and those witch hunter zealots. The dark entities he believed in granted his wish when, after days of aimless wandering, he found a small village near a slimy pond. There he settled as a priest, teaching the peasants about the Dark Gods and introducing them to their grimy sacraments. And so you were born, offspring of a ritual orgy.
qstr_Those_born_with_phys|Those born with physical anomalies are rejected by the imperial society, deemed monsters and left to live and die alone. Your father, his body defective but not his mind, spent his life trying to stay alive in the wilderness, learning how to provide for himself. This ended when he arrived to Sylvania after hearing rumors about how mutants are treated as normal people in that land. Not only he managed to get a home there, but he raised a little farmstead and a family. Thus you were born. 
qstr_Last_of_a_noble_bloo|Last of a noble bloodline, your father was a petty landlord belonging to the decadent sylvanian nobility. In his youth, he spent his days doing nothing but duelling over women, big game hunting and squandering his family's gold for his own delights. But sometimes too much unrestrained pleasure can lead to unwanted outcomes. Unwanted like you, son of a barmaid and rejected by your father.
qstr_Without_any_memory_l|Without any memory left from his life before the blood pact, your father was one of the personal servants of a vampire sire. Forcedly instructed about the use of weapons and the art of combat, his life was to fight his masters enemies, more a tool than a normal thug. Being his will completely null, he was forced to breed by his sire, to grant him more pawns to manipulate and blood to drink. Thus you were born.
qstr_Hailing_from_Wurtbad|Hailing from Wurtbad, the capitol city of Stirland, your father was a wine merchant. With his caravan he traveled across all of the Empire selling the renowned stirlander wine, and that's how he got to the misty lands of Sylvania. While on the road to Drakenhof, the next stop on his trade schedule, his caravan got attacked by bandits. Too frightened to stay and too coward to fight against the attackers, he fled on his horse, leaving all the other caravans behind. He was found lying in a muddy pool by some villagers some days after. Traumatized by the experience, he built his home in that village, never to leave again. He married with a peasant woman and had many babies. You were one of them.
qstr_A_warrior_can_be_str|A warrior can be strong, his skills unsurpassed, his will hard as steel. Still, that warriors going to fall without some good equipment pieces. That was your work: forging blades and armors for the finests of Ulthuan, bringing forth the tradition of the elven forges excellence. Strong your hammer hit the anvil, hot the smelter burnt as you crafted those deadly art pieces. Given your mastery within the smithy, you immediately accepted to follow the expedition for the Old World as soon as you were asked. But no one really knows what future brings. So, centuries later, you became...
qstr_Born_under_the_bless|Born under the blessing of Kurnous, you have always been gifted with a stupefying sight and an incredible sense of orientation. In the emptiest deserts as in the thickest forest, your inner guide would have led you to your mark as if your very blood was pointing the right way to follow. Your uncanny ability served you well when you proposed yourself to enter the expeditionary forces for the Old World as an explorer. However, your arrival to Athel Loren changed it all, making you into...
qstr_In_a_world_as_perilo|In a world as perilous as yours, where there is always something trying to kill something else, war is indeed one of the most prominent businesses, with entire populations devoted to its maintenance. You were one of the players of this dangerous game. You can't remember with precision what your unit, your home or your friends were like, their image torn away by scenes of blood and a feeling of fear earned by fighting in the War of Vengeance and witnessing its brutalities. So, lost to the world, you deserted, to get away your only goal. Your arrival here was like an elixir, as you saw a chance to begin again by becoming... 
qstr_The_elven_nature_is_|The elven nature is strongly tied with the winds of magic, their history dating back to the very first ages of the world. You pledged your very life on preserving this knowledge, becoming a quintessential magic tuner, lives of many flowing through yours. That's the reason why you were taken in the expeditionary force directed to the Old World, a living aspect of the elven culture and magical knowledge. But this very strong attunement to magic was the very factor that changed you upon reaching Athel Loren, turning you into...
qstr_As_an_emissary_of_Ul|As an emissary of Ulthuan and the Phoenix King, you were sent with the main colonial expedition to mediate with the inland populations inhabiting the continent. Your mission of peace was however interrupted by the outbreak of what came to be known as the War of Vengeance between your kin and the dwarves that inhabited the mountains and you, being a man of wisdom and words, not a warrior at all, fled in fear and found shelter in the great forest of Athel Loren.You settled in one of its clearings, slowly being reached by other elves escaping the war, and here you became...
qstr_Your_fascination_for|Your fascination for adventure and exotic places brought you to voluntary enlist yourself and your court in the ranks of the colonizers. You never cared about settling down and growing a colony of your own, instead you spent your time exploring and hunting, paying very little interest in your roles responsibilities. There is no wonder that when the War of Vengeance broke out, your scarce commitment to your own races defense brought you away from the fighting, leading you towards the forest of Athel Loren, where many other elves fled escaping the war. Here you found your home, and began your new life as...
qstr_The_highest_art_of_t|The highest art of the Dawi Zharr, binding daemons to an inanimate object is not only a dangerous and physically consuming practice but also the key to understand the power hidden in their crafts. A daemon binder, as you are, is an artificer of great ability and skill but also a dark adept of greater evil,  that someday could become a powerful Daemonsmith. Along the long road though, something changed you..
qstr_A_sadistic_master_of|A sadistic master of pain as entertainment, ritual or persuasion. A deep connoisseur of the roads and paths carved in the flesh of the living beings. Your dedication to the infliction of torment and sorrow over the bodies of your victims has always been a source of blithe satisfaction for your Lords, their atrocious agonies skillfully designed to last as long as possible, each drop of blood shed an offering to the Bull God. Until one day, something changed you...
qstr_A_position_of_main_i|A position of main importance in the slavery driven society of the Chaos Dwarfs, the slavemaster is not only the responsible for the total obedience and submission of his appointed subjects but also the one ruling and inciting them into battle, an activity your cruel iron fist made very easy to fulfill. Always ready to send the mob of worthless expendables to their utmost demise in name of your personal success, you joined the expedition, but along the road an unusual sight dazzled you... 
qstr_Unbent._Unbroken._Th|Unbent. Unbroken. The legions of the Dawi Zharr are made by some of the most disciplined and ruthless soldiers in the whole Old World. Under their heavy metal plates a core of magmatic and unforgiving brutality awaits the order to be unleashed. A skilled soldier, your lord decided your platoon would have joined him in the new imperialist mission. Little you knew, something would have changed you along the road...
qstr_One_of_the_lieutenan|One of the lieutenants of the Infernal Guard, a veteran of a thousand battles, a living weapon of Hashut, clad in blood and souls forged metal and dark magic, a penitent for your past misdeeds. As an Ironsworn, your extreme loyalty to the Father of Darkness and will to atone your sins did not find you faltering when the quest for expansion and greater glory was given, eager to bring death and dismay to the lesser races. One day though, something you witnessed caught your attention...
qstr_Indeed_the_Chaos_Dwa|Indeed the Chaos Dwarfs are an isolationist population, though their industry and society requires many resources and manpower to keep going. This is what you understood better than many others and that is why you took on yourself the honor of trading with the people of Norsca and the everhungry Ogres the trinkets and artifacts of your people for more slaves and metals. But even a traveler like you never really knows everything of the world, and so you learned something new at the sight of...
qstr_Your_father_taught_y|Your father taught you about the faith and dedication needed to defy the creeping chill of Chaos, nurturing you into self-sufficiency, asceticism and sense of companionship worthy of the wolves.
qstr_Loyalty_and_obedienc|Loyalty and obedience were everything to your father, who worked as a Chekist in the government, purging the Tsardom from the temptations of its inner enemies. You constantly saw his cunning at work - analyzing guests, provoking them into dangerous conversations, reading their every gesture as one would read a tome of law: the expression of order is the mark of wholeness in the eyes of the Chekist. 
qstr_As_part_of_Kislev_s_|As part of Kislev's determined aristocracy, your father exuded both charm and ruthlessness, a cold-hearted warmth unique to someone who for a long time has been in charge of peoples who reside at the very edge of life itself. No harsh winter or Norscan horde ever broke his will, forever steadfast and hopeful in the face of certain, implacable, encroaching death.
qstr_Dark_humor_and_a_bel|Dark humor and a belly full of beer is all you needed to survive, at least from the example set by your father, who spent long, frosty seasons protecting your home from unknown terrors. In the dark blue nights of the Far North, the only thing you can trust is the sizzle of the snow as the blood of your comrades stains the soil, the bond of the true Kossar, whose fate is inseparable from that of his companions' swords.
qstr_Your_father_taught_yo|Your father taught you that force was the path of truth, that in the vastness of the steppes the only thing that makes an echo is the strength of your will to take what you need. Farmers and city-dwellers can no longer hear that echo, and it is therefore your duty to remind them of its life-affirming power, of how your war-cry and their screams come to fill the void once more.
qstr_Your_father_was_a_hu|Your father was a hunter, an expert at braving the Northern elements, always coming back to the hearth just when you started to think the howls of the wind were getting loudest. He taught you about the different ways the snow falls, about the secrets of frozen lakes and the whims of Ursun's creatures, how they confront the barren landscape not only for survival, but also for the pleasure of finding themselves immersed, all alone, at the chilling heart of nature.
qstr_Your_early_youth_was|Your early youth was marked by the hard labor of keeping your home functional, helping your mother cook, maintain the fire, and repair the house. It was, after all, your sole refuge against the cold wills of angry gods.
qstr_As_a_child_you_once_|As a child, you once dreamed of a great polar bear battling a mountain and coming out victorious, standing majestically before you, its face bearing a thousand terrible scars. You felt close to the whiteness of the horizon, and held a deep sympathy towards the animals of the North, so alike and yet so different to yourself. You liked to follow around all sorts of nomadic mystics as the men of your village frowned and the women shook their heads in disapproval. 
qstr_Amazed_at_the_power_|Amazed at the power to bend entire ice-scapes to their will, you went into the service of a coven of Ice Witches, learning about the divinity of Winter and its fiery, burning passion. Having no magical aptitude, you could only study and serve their wishes, handling rare elements and coming to understand the sublime processes of Ice in due time.
qstr_The_growth_of_your_v|The growth of your village reflected not only the Tsarina's vision of order but also the expertise of its leader, the Ataman. Burdened by the extensions of authority, the Ataman formed a small group of Counselors of which you became a part of, thanks, perhaps, to desperation and luck in equal measure. Power, you finally understood, begins and ends with the frontier, with the menace of Chaos.
qstr_After_losing_everyth|After losing everything in a terrible icestorm, you followed a Kyazak raiding party for days on end. They noticed you from the very beginning, but realized a lost, starving young Kislevite was no danger to their group. After a few weeks that you survived out of scraps and roots, they finally sent a warrior to challenge you, to test your mettle. With your soul having finally known the true stillness of the cold, you fiercely defeated your enemy, appearing like an indomitable force of nature to the rest of the party. They embraced you as one of their own, and let you ride along them to the far reaches of the world for a time.
qstr_You_were_sworn_in_to|You were sworn in to the service of a Druzhina, a local minor aristocrat that taught you the ways of the Kislevite noble warrior. You slowly came to understand the will of the Tsarina, and your allegiance to the laws of her lands became indisputable as you aided the swords and the shields the Druzhina represented, piercing through the darkness so as to let the great still whiteness reign forever in its stead. 
qstr_Your_father_was_one_|Your father was one of the strongest of your tribe and felt the calling of his God as soon as he killed^his first victim on the battlefield. Greatly respected by everyone in your tribe he was an inspiration to you and other young tribesman^and you learnt much from him until he left in a mighty warband and never came back.
qstr_Your_father_rode_a_g|Your father rode a gigantic chariot into battles with 8 feet long scythes and wheels made out of iron so hard they^would crush anyone who went under them. The chariot was pulled by 2 of the largest horses you had ever seen and his exploits^on the battlefield led to him having one of the greatest reputations amongst all the tribes.
qstr_Your_father_was_a_dr|Your father was a drunk with no comprehension of defence and preservation on the^battlefield. He would get completely hammered before a battle and then launch himself headlong into the mightiest^unit his enemies had to offer. It was amazing he lived long enough to spread his seed.
qstr_Your_father_was_a_ma|Your father was a man who liked what he liked and kept himself to himself. He wasn't loud or brash like many Norse and^he was quite a quiet person. He was a lumberjack of great strength and stamina who chopped wood day and night for the Chaos navy so that they can build^their invasion fleets and replace any they lost in battles.
qstr_Your_father_was_an_a|Your father was an adventuring barbarian who loved nothing more than exploring the deepest mountain^caverns and dungeons for the world's forgotten treasures. He led a party of 4 including an elf, a dwarf and a wizard. In his life he^defeated warboss Gorgutt, the necromancer Gunther Laranscheld and the great minotaur king who dwelt in a fighting pit near your stronghold.
qstr_Your_father_was_the_c|Your father was the chieftain of a large marauder tribe who constantly harried the Empire and were always one of the first^to answer the campaign call. He was a nearly 7 foot tall and as strong as a bull, wielding his trusted axe he could cut a man in half with 1 swing. He took great pride in^his set of Norsca horses and taught you to ride as soon as you could walk.
qstr_Your_father_was_a_te|Your father was a temple guard who had the duty of guarding the sacred temples in times of peace and if the army was summoned to go and meet a foreign^force then the temple guard will also join the ranks as they are too fierce a unit not to utilise. If the army has a Slaan mage priest in it then the temple guards will stay with^him and guard him with their lives.
qstr_Lizardmen_don_t_get_|Lizardmen don't get the respect they deserve outside of Lustria and many other races consider them unintelligent and poor military^leaders but this is very far from the truth. The Saurus' are experts in the military arts and your father was a tactician who worked specifically on how to defeat the^different human armies of the world.
qstr_Your_father_was_an_o|Your father was an old blood with a personal loyal army of over 250 troops. He had a long history with the Lizardman armies and was^one of the lead Old Blood's in the Lustria invasion force sent into the Old World to defeat the chaos. He was killed in one of the 3 great battles in the land between^Kraka Dorden and Praag but his army won the battle in his honour and then took his body back to Lustria for a great ceremony.
qstr_{reg3?daughter:son}|{reg3?daughter:son}
qstr_Your_father_was_part|Your father was part of an elite cavalry unit in the Lustria invasion force. He was immensely tough and durable, often one of the last^still undefeated when the battles are down to the last men. He once took a Khorne axe square in the chest from a chosen warrior at full speed and not only survived but^turned around and speared the warrior with your lance afterwards. It took 3 hours to remove the axe from your fathers body and the story stayed with him throughout his ^military career.
qstr_Lustria_is_full_of_a|Lustria is full of amazing architecture from great pyramids to giant totem poles and great decorated gates. Your father was one of the great^architects who understood the Gods and understood the critical importance of every detail in Lustrian architecture.
qstr_Your_father_was_a_kr|Your father was a kroxigor trainer who took takes kroxigors a couple of weeks after birth and brings them up on an intense regime^of training which prepares them for their future requirements on the battlefield and make sure that they are as easy to communicate with as possible.

To anyone doubting of your orkiness, you explained your reasons: a punch on their face followed by your lesson <<Eh, it thro rokks very far, an rokks are very smashy, don ye know ya grotz!?>>. Many got taught by you in your tribe.But in the end they were right, pulling a lever to throw rocks isnt as exciting as it did seem, so you became.
qstr_What_is_better_than_|What is better than a raging beast? A raging beast riding on another raging beast, apparently. Riding a boar is not the easiest of things, considering that most of those who try to end up with a tusk-carved hole through their body. But you managed to submit one of those wild beasts to your will, earning yourself the status of 'boar rider'. On your ferocious mount, you used to ride across the battlefield crushing everything standing in your way to a red unrecognizable pulp, for Gork and your Boss. Unfortunately your boar got killed during a fight and, unwilling to go through the risky taming process with another beast, you choose to become.
qstr_Bloodbowl_is_surely_|Bloodbowl is surely the most loved and followed sport in the world, with teams and players coming from all kingdoms and lands. Still, its not the only sport being practiced.Snotling Throwing is one of the many niche sports, practiced almost solely by orcs, with many amateurs and a core of few real professionals, like you were.   Raising the snotling from the ground, feeling the screaming hunchy little bastard desperately moving in your hand trying to get free, your eyes bound to the horizon and then, the throw. <<Dat gits got da arm of Gork and da precishun of Mork>> your fans used to say about you.But one day, a snotling bit two fingers off your throwing hand, so you had to change your career and became.
qstr_Every_WAAAGH!_has_a_|Every WAAAGH! has a mastermind guiding it toward the final goal. This mastermind is usually composed by the WAAAGHs Boss and his advisors. Your uncommon cunning and the almost unbelievable existence of something resembling reasoning inside your otherwise void filled cranium, made you one of the latters.   Though, the life of a Bossez personal advisor is not an easy one, considering how common it is for an orc Boss to slaughter them when things dont go as planned. And thats why you sneaked away, abandoning your charge and position with no hesitation, after your WAAAGHs big plan utterly failed. Cowardice sometimes means survival.Leaving your old tribe behind, you set out to become.
qstr_When_many_orcs_band_|When many orcs band together, a strange power results from the gathering. The more the orcs, the bigger the energy generated by their interaction.    Not all greenskins are capable of feeling it and even fewer are the ones able to harness it and translate it in a material form: these are the shamans, just like you were.Bringing forth <<da wordz of Gork an Mork>>, you bathed in the WAAAGHs liquid rage only to catalyze it within your body, ready to unleash the wrath of the Twin Gods over the <<not-green weaklings>>. Recognizing your divine mission, you began aspiring for more and decided to become.
qstr_As_a_particularly_wi|As a particularly wise goblin once said {Da best part ov a fight iz when ye get to loot da shiny bitz}. No one could disagree with that, and his fellows kept discussing that unbreakable truth even while mounting their intellectual kin onto the nearest doom katapult, pulling the lever and sending him to smash against the enemy dwarf fortress walls. Though, true to that statement, you made your early life out of cleaning the battlefields of everything you deemed worth something, until the time came for you to find something different to carry on with your life, so you became...
qstr_Being_goblins_a_race|Being goblins a race affected by chronic cowardice, you sighed in relief when the boss of your tribe put a spear and a shield in your hands, as you knew you would never have to fight face to face against the enemy, but crouched behind your wooden shield while trying to hit something at distance with your stikka. At least that is what you were hoping for. The revelation hit you with the speed of an imperial cavalry charge, an actual cavalry charge, truth be told. As soon as you saw the heavily armored knights approaching your unit, you sprang up, threw your shield to the ground, braced your spear and started running and screaming in the enemys opposite direction, until no one could see you on the horizon. A true survivor, you decided to become.
qstr_All_goblins_are_afra|All goblins are afraid of squigs, only a few are crazy enough to try and tame them, even fewer survive the experience. Yet, your boss wanted to try taming and riding a squig so much and you, lucky chosen, got sent right into the squigs cave with only a lit lantern to bait out the light sensitive creatures and a shoddy leather vest, because safety always comes first. And so you spent your days in and out of the dark caves, running away from TEEEEEFFZ!,  as your hunt-mates outside the cavern could hear you scream from the bellies of the earth, for your bosses happiness, until he eventually grew bored of the idea of taming squigs, making your struggles against them nasty beasts completely pointless. Forced to find something else to do, you then became.
qstr_An_eminent_imperial_|An eminent imperial scholar from Averland said You are what you eat. He was probably talking about greenskins, with a particular emphasis on goblins, as they not only do eat mushrooms but they drink them too. And this is where you step in: a cultivator. Planting the mushrooms, growing them while learning the differences and peculiarities of each species and experimenting with their properties. Your work not only kept the tribes food tent full, and consequently your tribes stomaches, but granted the shamans a rich stash of ingredients for their concoctions and potions. Anyway, you grew tired of living your life secluded in the growing cave, so you set out to become...
qstr_It_was_not_too_long_|It was not too long before your tribe got assimilated by a bigger orcs WAAAGH! in need for some new helpin handz. Considered an asset slightly more valuable than the average squig roasting on the fire, you and other kins of yours got assigned to the building and dismantling of the WAAAGH!s camp, a very important but dangerous task where a goblin can easily die, be it crushed by the heavy wooden beams of the tents or because of the hilarious jokes of the orcs, who find that the goblins moar squishy den oomiez. Yet you survived this all, thank Mork, and took your chance to escape one night. Joining a new goblin tribe, you lived as...
qstr_While_marching_throu|While marching through a forest, returning from one of your tribes usual campaigns for sheer massacre and loot, you met with a band of forest goblins. Fascinated by their weird tribal apparel and facepaints, you followed them to their camp. There they showed you the sacred altars of Mork and Gork, though they were unusually covered in cobwebs and many weird totems depicting spider forms stood all around them. You remained with the forest goblins, embraced their cult of spiders, learnt how to ride them. Your newfound faith came to a critical halt when the tribes shaman chose you, and others, as a sacrifice for da mighty Arachnarok. Loyal to your goblin nature, you fled the tribe and the forest, your legs faster than wind, swearing to Mork you will never want to see a spider again. Back to your former tribe, you became...
qstr_Like_many_other_youn|Like many other young Elves you dedicated yourself to study and learning about your Gods, the history of your race and^what has to be done to secure the future of your proud nation. You studied other races and cultures and also the wonders of nature and prophesies that are^yet to take place.
qstr_High_Elf_armour_is_s|High Elf armour is some of the most beautiful and intricate in the world. Often incorporating plate, scale and textile^in one it takes a skilled armourer to get the finished piece perfect. It takes years and years of training and you spent a few in the service of your uncle^who owned 3 armouries in Ulthuan.
qstr_You_joined_the_local|You joined the local militia out of duty. As the ages progress the High Elf lands and population is getting smaller and smaller and the threats^to Ulthuan's survival get greater as the trend continues. The High Elves are blessed with a high standard of troops but even so the High King and his Lords are very on edge^about security and it is an expectation of the young to get military experience even if they aim for a civilian career in case of all out war for survival.
qstr_You_started_your_wor|You started your working life as an emissary for the Lords and Nobles of Ulthuan running messages around the world and making^sure that the flow of information is as up to date as can possibly be.
qstr_The_High_Elves_are_a|The High Elves are a very sophisticated race who like to concern themselves with politics, intrigue, the arts and ceremony.^They like to make a point of how polarised they are from the Dark Elves in how they live and behave so if you are a talented musician there will always be^work for you as everyday, somewhere there is a feast or event going on where you will be required. You learnt to use the harp and primarily your voice as^your main instrument.
qstr_You_were_a_sentry_fo|You were a sentry for the jails which were kept on board the massive Lothern vessels which sail the seas to protect the Elven coast and to^fight back the incursions of pirates and corsairs. Due to the amount of sea activity the jails were always full and being a sentry was an important job as pirates are^very crafty at breaking out and also sneaking aboard to try and break others out.
qstr_One_of_the_most_adva|One of the most advantageous traits of the Elves is the sheer speed and grace of movement of a well trained warrior.^You spent your early years practicing how to be fast and agile both unarmed and with a polearm so that when you enter service in the years to come^you will be more than able to look after yourself.
qstr_All_of_your_thought_|All of your thought was hell bent on becoming  military leader and expanding the Dark Elf territories in a way that has never been achieved before.^You were accepted to a military academy and studied tactics and leadership skills as well as the entire history of the Dark Elf army. By the end of your studies you had mastered^the theory of all components of a traditional Dark Elf army as well as what to expect from the other armies of the Old World
qstr_It_is_generally_held|It is generally held that the High Elves are the keen scholars of the Old World and that Dark Elves do not have^the kind of culture which values the written word and the accumulation or knowledge through the literary arts. This is of course far from the truth^and you worked for a large institute in Hag Greaf as a diplomatic scribe, chronicling all communication from the outside world to Naggaroth.
qstr_The_Dark_Elves_love_|The Dark Elves love to torture their enemies and nothing is as disappointing to a torturer than their captive dying before^they have finished having their fun. You were trained in first aid, wound treatment and surgery for all races so that you could help keep the captives^alive for as long as you can. This role was created just for hedonistic purposes but also because every warrior has their breaking point and your work^has allowed that point to be reached, and key information retrieved, after a point where the captive would usually be dead.
qstr_You_were_part_of_a_2|You were part of a 2 man repeater crossbow team, both of you were equally trained.^Your training included aiming, reloading and movement and also the ability to choose the most tactically appropriate target both on the battlefield and in sieges.
qstr_You_were_a_sentry_for|You were a sentry for the jails which were always full to the brim with prisoners of all races. Whether they were brought back by^an army or by ship after a corsair raid their captives outlook for a salvation was a grim one when captured by the Drucchi because they are usually wroth to give^back prisoners, even for the extortionate prices offered for them. Everyone knows this so escape attempts and rebellions by large groups of prisoners happened at^any opportunity although you were part of a well trained sentry team who knew how to deal with any trouble with ruthless efficiency.
qstr_You_joined_your_loca|You joined your local mining to mine the gemstones which are traded to the Empire for a vast amount of gold. Mining is a very typical profession fora young Dwarf and your time in the mines was pretty uneventful and you were never called to war.
qstr_The_Dwarves_like_to_|The Dwarves like to horde their wealth and keep themselves to themselves but they recognise the desires of other races to trade for their riches, especially^the Empire who are the Dwarves closest ally so they don't shut themselves off completely. You joined a small merchants firm to learn how to trade and also to learn about other races and cultures^as you decided your long term future lies out of the tunnels and out in the wide world.
qstr_You_worked_as_a_tunn|You worked as a tunneller expanding the vast network of tunnels and caverns inside the great Dwarven underground areas. You had 2 main duties which you alternated between^in shifts. One was the actual tunnelling and shaping the tunnels and making sure they are safe and the other was to inspect the many tunnels that have already been made and make sure that all the light^sources are working properly and if not to fix them.
qstr_If_you_observe_a_Dwa|If you observe a Dwarven army you will see wave after wave of axes poking up from above the heads of the stout and immensely tough Dwarves^marching and singing toward the field of battle. The production of axes is therefore a critical and vast industry and you became the apprentice of a retired ironbreaker^who put his retirement fund into setting up a massive weaponsmith to supply the northern army.
qstr_You_were_a_brutish_t|You were a brutish thug in your early days. You spent alot of your time above ground with a group of Imperial bandits and halfling thieves^who hid in deep thickets waiting for traveller to come down a road which was the only road for miles and jumping them as they past. As you were the biggest muscle in the^crew and often helped the others out when you jumped a more able defender you got the best share of the takings after each raid.
qstr_You_were_asked_by_yo|You were asked by your towns guild master to take the job as a caravan guard as the pirates were intercepting over a third of all^the Dwarven caravans sent out. You didn't really fancy the job but the look of desperation on the guildmaster's face was enough to make you swallow your plans for a year^or so and do a good turn for the town you were brought up in.
qstr_Many_young_rats_are_|Many young rats are used as slaves to dig fresh tunnels in the mountains and under the plains to extend the^Skaven network. You were assigned to one of these groups and spent 4 long grueling years digging tunnels under enemy territory.
qstr_You_were_a_warpstone|You were a warpstone miner working one of the least profitable mines near the mountains on the Bretonnian border. You mined refined warpstone^which is far less dangerous than the unrefined kind and you managed to go your entire time in the mine without gaining any mutations or unusual effect much to your disappointment.^You often spent day without finding anything and when you did the master would snatch your find away as soon as he can.
qstr_Skaven_clanrats_gene|Skaven clanrats generally do not last long on the battlefield or in the dungeon. They are treated with disdain by nearly every other race and generally lack the^toughness and equipment to prove everyone wrong. The main form of defence for clanrats is a small but sturdy round shield usually decorated with symbols or pictures. You worked tirelessly making^these shields for all the main armies. It was a relentless job because of the phenomenal amount of fresh Skaven going into service every year.
qstr_Whereas_slavery_is_m|Whereas slavery is maligned in many cultured it is engrained in the Skaven way of life and any Skaven unable to stand up for himself^or acquire a useful skill set is most likely to go down this route. You were among the many in your early life when you were forced into a slave colony run by Clan^Moulder and forced to do whatever the whim of your master was. After a dwarf raid you managed to slip away in the chaos and start a new life.
qstr_The_adventuring_part|The adventuring parties of the Old World are obsessed with heading underground on some quest or another in search of gold or treasure or the^blagging rights to killing the biggest monster. Because of this the lairs and tunnel networks are becoming less and less secret as the years have gone on and secrecy is of^paramount importance to the ruling council. Special assassin teams patrol the network to quickly dispose of any trespassers in the more secretive areas and your job was a runner^through these routes to spot trespassers and get their location to the assassin teams as soon as possible.
qstr_Skaven_have_an_all_c|Skaven have an all consuming distrust of the inferior land dwelling species although their distrust of each other is almost as intense. Whether on an individual,^group or clan level the Skaven always saw treachery in everything and would do anything they could to raise their status in society at anyone and everyone's expense. You were hired as a mole^to infiltrate different groups and plans and report back to the council anything you found out.
qstr_You_spent_your_early|You spent your early days working at a nobleman's farmstead. The farming tools were your only and best friends and with them you spent your days caring for the crops, hard working in the sylvanian cold weather. Such a humble way of living left you little time to discover the world surrounding you but surely tempered your body, gifting you with an uncanny resistance to fatigue or harsh conditions. But then, one dark night, a strange figure came to you. His eyes were empty, his pale skin glistening in the moonlight. He spoke to you of greater power, of neverending youth and eternal life: he made you an offer. You could have had it all, you wanted it all, so you accepted his offering. And so, he gave you your Blood Kiss.
qstr_You_ve_always_been_w|You've always been with that weird old man of knowledge as far as you can remember, assisting him in uncovering the secrets of nature and questioning reality itself. His laboratory was your home, his experiments your lessons. What you haven't learned by reading the books in his enormous library, you learned by watching him messing around with strange concoctions and chanting formulae.^But then, one dark night, a strange figure came to you. His eyes were empty, his pale skin glistening in the moonlight. He spoke to you of greater power, of neverending youth and eternal life: he made you an offer. You could have had it all, you wanted it all, so you accepted his offering. And so, he gave you your Blood Kiss.
qstr_Working_at_the_flank|Working at the flank of the workshop's owner every day, got you to learn the rudiments of trading and bartering. With time, you became a bargainer so skilled that your mentor even thought about leaving you his store. But then, one dark night, a strange figure came to you. His eyes were empty, his pale skin glistening in the moonlight. He spoke to you of greater power, of neverending youth and eternal life: he made you an offer. You could have had it all, you wanted it all, so you accepted his offering. And so, he gave you your Blood Kiss.
qstr_A_mindless_puppet_th|A mindless puppet, that's what you were. With your mind in the hands of your puppeteer, your body had no other options left than to obey. And so you slogged for all your early life at the orders of your master, carrying on every single task he demanded from you without talking back a single word, no matter how humiliating those task could be. But then, one dark night, a strange figure came to you. His eyes were empty, his pale skin glistening in the moonlight. He spoke to you of greater power, of neverending youth and eternal life: he made you an offer. You could have had it all, you wanted it all, so you accepted his offering. And so, he gave you your Blood Kiss.
qstr_Raised_on_the_street|Raised on the streets, you never knew a law other than yours. You and the other kids from the streets formed quite a quirky little gang, spending your days between little criminal actions and trying to stay away from the unforgiving grasp of the guards. But then, one dark night, a strange figure came to you. His eyes were empty, his pale skin glistening in the moonlight. He spoke to you of greater power, of neverending youth and eternal life: he made you an offer. You could have had it all, you wanted it all, so you accepted his offering. And so, he gave you your Blood Kiss.
qstr_Not_everyone_is_born|Not everyone is born rich and for sure you were not. Forced to choose between dying alone of starvation or finding a way to get some food, you chose the latter. Sylvania is a place full of mass burial grounds and long forgotten cemeteries, and so you started unhearthing the remains of the long departed searching for coins and small precious to exchange for a loaf of maggoty bread.But then, one dark night, a strange figure came to you. His eyes were empty, his pale skin glistening in the moonlight. He spoke to you of greater power, of neverending youth and eternal life: he made you an offer. You could have had it all, you wanted it all, so you accepted his offering. And so, he gave you your Blood Kiss.
qstr_The_forces_of_nature|The forces of nature changed you gradually, unlocking new powers to one of every livings most instinctive feature: voice. With your mind perfectly tuned with the forests ancient melody, you began singing your own songs over this primordial music, growing and shaping the forest to your own vision and will. An architect of wonders, a singer of trees, with your melodies you helped growing entire cities and realms between branches and roots, your mind inspired by your deep devotion to..
qstr_Athel_Loren_became_n|Athel Loren became not only your home but a living part of your existence. Your symbiotic connection with the forest sprang a strong protective feeling toward it. Sworn to keep intruders at bay, you took on your mission to guard its treasures from any kind of ruin. A shadow among the shadows, your eyes always open and vigilant, your arrows always ready to bring death to natures enemies, your actions, even in this new life, driven forth by your devotion to...
qstr_Never_you_would_have|Never you would have expected of becoming a liege, but natures ways are the most mysterious ones. Your wisdom and dedication to the welfare of your community granted you the status of Highborn. Your people described you as a benevolent and calm leader in times of peace, a righteous ruler over your small kingdom, while a turbulent fury on the battlefield, capable of great victories even in the most unfavorable conditions. But in your heart you knew it was not all your merit, as you have always felt blessed by.
qstr_Athel_Loren_is_inhab|Athel Loren is inhabited by every kind of living creature, from the most peculiar ones like the forests magical spirits to the most commons like beasts and animals. When you first woke up in the forest, after an unknown incident happened,  you found yourself surrounded by a pack of wolves. With your great surprise, you were greeted and accepted like one of them. Thus, you began living with them, slowly mastering your newborn ability to tame and control beasts. But, even living alone in the forest with your new animal family, you never stopped worshipping your chosen deity...
qstr_The_winds_of_nature_|The winds of nature blow strong through the thick mantle made of leaves, cradling the many ancient spirits that inhabit Athel Loren from times immemor. You saw some of their physical manifestations during your time here, you witnessed their power and studied their behaviours enough to be able to estabilish an unique connection with them. Your kin then began to hold you in high regard as one of the few able to communicate with the spirits of the forest, to ask them for guidance or to wake them to join the armies of nature when the tides of war arose. By the way, you were sure that this path you were walking was all in the plans of...
qstr_Spring_Summer_Autumn|Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter. Birth, Life, Sunset, Death. Living under the emerald ceiling of the forest slowly made you one with nature's course. A being blessed through the ultimate identification with all of creation. Such a gift, possessed only by the chosen ones of your people, made you become one of the personal guards of King Orion, the living embodiment of Kurnous himself, supreme liege of your kin all. Your savage power, your instinctive thoughts, your feral look were all hints of your complete transformation into something more similar to a forest spirit. Anyway, your previous self still existed deep in your soul, that is why you have never completely stopped worshipping...
qstr_While_traversing_the|While traversing the frozen passes of the World Edge Mountains, the great black columns of the Dawi Zharr reached once more the ground and entered the northernmost eerie white plains of the Troll Country. After a while, the snow under their feet began to feel quite different and many started looking what they were stepping on as you did too. Emerging from the countless footprints and wheeltracks left in the snow, the remains of thousands of battles between great armies of humans, trolls and other warped creatures started littering the path. The sight of such a great display of supreme belligerence filled you with renewed strength, maybe influencing your decision to become..
qstr_Entering_the_frozen_|Entering the frozen lands of Norsca, the white empty vastness of the Troll Country began mutating into a jagged frozen landscape made of towering black stone spikes and teeth, lacerating the candid mantle of the snow as a beast plunging its fangs into the belly of its prey. It was while passing between two rocky walls, that you and few others started noticing weird inscriptions and figures carved in one of the sides of the mountains. At first it was really difficult for you to read it and figure out the message of those runes, but after a while all became clearer. It was a map, maybe from many ages before, depicting the lands of the Old World and how to safely traverse them. With this knowledge, you felt ready to become...
qstr_During_their_long_jo|During their long journey across the norscan frozen mountains and vales, the Dawi Zharr encountered a peculiar mountain, its top flat as if beheaded by a furious blow, dense black clouds crowning the bastion of black naked stone. The Prophets felt a strong magical presence coming from the top of that mountain, so you and a few others were sent to the top to investigate the source of such incredible wild power. There, you saw it. A single ancient man, his flesh and skin twisted and warped by the flowing powers of Chaos. The old sorcerer noticed your group, and with a single gesture invited you to join his ritual. You felt the raw chaotic energies taking hold of you and giving you unholy knowledge, advising you in your decision to become...
qstr_Soon_after_reaching_|Soon after reaching the heartlands of Norsca, the travelling column of the Chaos Dwarfs came to witness one of the great barbarian strongholds. A band of chaos riders soon approached the head of the army, bringing word that the lord of the stronghold wanted you all to join the great feast in honor of the Chaos Gods. That night the flames burned bright and high over the feasting host, sacrifices were made and ale flown in rivers among marauders and dwarfs alike. You were about to bite some kind of roasted pork leg, when an hulking barbarian came to you and bellowed his challenge. You cannot remember much of what happened later due to all that ale, yet you know the giant was laying on the floor in a matter of moments and all your fellows were hailing your victory. This surge of popularity convinced you to become...
qstr_Entering_the_western|Entering the western regions of the norscan iced lands, the voyage became harder, with snow storms slowing the march and spoiling the provisions and the ever stronger warpstorms hailing from the northern Chaos Wastes. After weeks of surviving in this hostile environment, the sound of a battle horn was heard over the screaming winds. Following the loud wail of the horn, the Dawi Zharr found an encampment held by a large horde of Chaos Marauders. They offered you safe harbor and trading opportunities, and you did not miss the chance to trade some trinkets and weapons from your equipment in exchange for resources, slaves and a small amount of precious gold. With the bigger storms gone, you and the others left the encampment, ready to finally end your journey, though that small stash you traded for, made you decide to become...
qstr_After_months_of_trav|After months of travelling across mountains, snow white plains and frozen canyons, the westernmost coast of Norsca was finally in sight. Some of your kin had already set out to establish new outposts and colonies in norscan lands, but many more remained, their godsent quest leading them to the tall and rocky shores of Albion. As soon as you got there, a camp was set up to prepare for the oceanic travel. You were among those who were sent out to scout for building materials, and that is how you saw it. Along the coast, a conglomerate of big wrecked hulls and head figures, of masts and lacerated sails, stood like the carcass of a dead monster. The remains of the norscan ships were readily studied and deconstructed, their design secrets now yours too. The Chaos Dwarfs finally set out for the final destination of their travel, and you decided to become...
qstr_You_had_no_idea_what|You had no idea what you wanted to do with your life when you were younger and so you thought you would go on the road most travelled^and join the local militia. You were neither enthusiastic nor complacent and performed you duties to a high standard, impressing all the officers but you did not share the^passion most of your fellow troops shared. Your training made you fit and battle ready and when your contract ran out you were offered a promotion with high pay but you rejected^stating that you wished to go home and reflect on your life. You were scorned by the military for not accepting such a generous offer but you did not care.
qstr_You_were_never_the_m|You were never the most popular person in the Empire so it made sense you^started your life as a bailiff working for a scandalous landlord in the city of Talabheim. He had ways of draining the wealth^of his tenants and was always ready to send you in when the payments were even an hour late. You gained confidence from the job but^you quit after a retired greatsword gave you the beating of your life when you went to collect on one of your bosses devious hidded^charges. You left in search of a more honourable life.
qstr_There_was_always_lot|There was always lots of wealth and alot of goods moving around the Empire and there^was a market for anything once you know where to look. You started off a small business selling second hand goods but soon^citizens were bringing you their new merchandise to sell on their behalf after seeing how sharp your business acumen was.^You amassed a great deal of wealth and contacts but eventually left the business to your brother is search of a new direction.
qstr_You_loved_Blood_Bowl|You loved Blood Bowl when you were young and your father was one of the star players of his team.^He forced into way into the team and quickly became a star who led the team onto many trophies. His career was undone though because of a bitter feud with^Morg'N'Thorg after he ko'd him into the crowd, breaking his hip and causing the rioting crowd to stamp him to within an inch of his life. When he re-entered the game Morg'N'Thorg^was out for revenge and he persuaded every opponent his team faced to choose him as an inducement and he always put on an amazing game. They traded blows game after game but in the end his performances^were costing your team games so your coach sacked your father to get Morg'N'Thorg off their case.
qstr_You_were_always_prou|You were always proud of your nations technological prowess and you were fascinated with^firearms ever since you were a little kid. As soon as your education finished you worked as an apprentice to the local gunsmith.^You learnt how to put together, clean, modify and also how to shoot the many varieties the Empire had to offer.
qstr_The_Empire_was_massi|The Empire was massive and the need for information was always great between the Elector Counts and^their cities. Updates on raids, wars, witchcraft, politics, and trade were always relentlessly needed so you joined a program as a teenager^as a messenger for the Elector Counts and their officials. Speed and discretion was your game and you were never late in your duties.
qstr_You_grew_up_on_tales|You grew up on tales of knights and lances and dreamed of being one yourself but in reality you found^out you were most skilled with the bow and arrow. You trained 5 times weekly in what you anticipated would be for war but when the great climate^changes befell Bretonnia and crops failed in every province you were spending most of your time hunting animals for meat so that families^could be fed enough to survive.
qstr_Your_love_of_poetry_|Your love of poetry and music, as well as the limelight in big gatherings^meant you had a very happy start to life. As a talented singer and storyteller you were invited to the best^feasts and gatherings and played for hours to whoever would listen. Always drunk on wine, or maybe even just the moment,^the great famine brought you down to earth as the lack of food meant no feasts and no party atmosphere.
qstr_Being_a_solitary_and|Being a solitary and stern man the job of outrider was perfect for you and you were perfect for^those who hired you. Your job was to ride ahead of war parties, caravans and diplomatic travellers and scope out any threats and dangers that lay ahead.^It was a dangerous job with a low life expectancy but you are skilled in both the arts of fighting and also the arts of spotting and tracking.^Although ordered to leave threats to be dealt with by strike parties often you would ride out and deal with small parties on your own.^You are a stealthy man who can manage to scout and track without being seen and surrounded which is the primary cause of outrider deaths.
qstr_You_loved_Blood_Bowl_|You loved Blood Bowl when you were young and as soon as you got an opportunity to train with your local team you couldn't say no.^You forced your way into your team and quickly became a young starlet who led your team onto many trophies. Your career was undone though because of a bitter feud with^Morg'N'Thorg after you ko'd him into the crowd, breaking his hip and causing the rioting crowd to stamp him to within an inch of his life. When he re-entered the game Morg'N'Thorg^was out for revenge and he persuaded every opponent your team faced to choose him as an inducement and he always put on an amazing game. You traded blows game after game but in the end his performances^were costing your team games so your coach sacked you to get Morg'N'Thorg off their case.
qstr_Food_was_scarce_when|Food was scarce when you were young, even for rats so they were getting more and more bolder in their^search for food. Your village simply could not afford to have rats steal or infect the little food you had so your job was to hunt down^and kill them. You were lightening quick and this only made you faster although very drenched on those wet Bretonnian nights.
qstr_Although_you_never_a|Although you never admitted it publicly you admired the technology of the Empire and the advantages^it gave them in warfare. The closest the Bretonnians have to the great inventions of the Empire is the trebuchet which is used to great affect^in sieges. You attended many assaults by the main army and did your utmost to prove Bretonnian technology can win the day as much as the sword can.
qstr_You_were_fascinated_|You were fascinated by the doctors and healers who practiced in the great cities of your nation^You spent your early life in study and as a part time helper for a physician who was also a friend of your mother. You learnt many^things about the human body and the medicinal properties of the world around you, skills which will suit you well as a leader of many toiling fighters.
qstr_Flying_carpets_are_a|Flying carpets are a wonder of your nation and an item only the most prestigious person can own.^You always wanted wealth and recognition so you trained and excelled as a flying carpet maker and you took it upon yourself to^sell them as well in order to cut out the middle man and also so the rich and powerful could know your name.
qstr_A_great_deal_is_made|A great deal is made of obedience to the laws of the land if you are Arabian. There is great toleration for the customs^and cultural mistakes of foreigners while they are in Araby but that courtesy does not extend to it's own people. The law and customs are very strict and^are often broken. The jails are often very populated because of this and many jailers were needed because of this. It is not a very well respected job but it is^well paid so you worked there for quite a long time.
qstr_You_started_life_on_|You started life on patrol as a desert rider who was part of a scouting group^who often rode the Araby/Nehekhara border. You were the best horse archer in your patrol and knew how to keep^a controlled distance away from your enemy whilst on the assault.
qstr_You_spent_your_early_|You spent your early life in Lashiek among thieves learning how to navigate the seas and how to beat the^pirates at their own game. You learnt to be stealthy on land and smart on the sea but always quick and purposeful. You were in debt^and this is how you worked to pay it off although it became to dangerous for you to be in the city after a while so you were never able^to make much of a surplus.
qstr_The_Ashiwara_are_the|The Ashiwara are the most peaceful and siplomatic caln in Nippon. They are masters of domestic and foreign affairs and when war does break out they have the best archers in the whole of Nippon to defend them.
qstr_The_Uruchi_clan_is_h|The Uruchi clan is home to the sumo warriors and are the most aggressive clan in the entire country. Their sheer levels of violence and brutality on the battlefield have led to scorn being cast on them by all of the other clans on the island.
qstr_When_the_Empire_brou|When the Empire brought gunpowder to Nippon the Batake saw it's significance and have obsessively mastered the creation and utilisation of seige weapons and war machines with the new prized resource. Their tactics are considered dishonourable by many but their knowledge is far in advance of any other clan and fears are widespread that one day they will be too strong to stop.
qstr_The_Shinzei_are_an_i|The Shinzei are an isolated and highly skilled clan who created the art of nijitsu and train the ninja warriors who hire themselves out throughout the mainland. They are greatly distrusted by other clans due to the impact of the ninjas and the assasination schools but they are also a key defence against the undead hordes in the north and for this reason are left alone.
qstr_The_Mushagi_are_mast|The Mushagi are master commanders of the battlefield and have the most battle hardened army of ashigaru in the world. Their treatment and respect of the peasant ranks in their army is a key part of their military success but they are frequently scorned by other clans for treating the lowborn their equals.
qstr_The_Daimatzu_are_the|The Daimatzu are the strictest and most honourable of all the clans. They are master sword makers and masters of the art of sword fighting and they are by far the best duelists in Nippon, arguably the world. They are seen as arrogant by the other clans.
qstr_The_pirates_are_stro|The pirates are strong but their enemies are often just as strong if not stronger and the brotherhood does not^always have it their own way. Sometimes it takes political games in order to sustain the stability of the faction so envoys were needed to send^and receive politic messages such as truces and treaties. You spent your early life as an envoy for the brotherhood as a face for pirate diplomacy^and with the responsibility of peace in your hands.
qstr_You_loved_riches_lik|You loved riches like any pirate and you didn't care where you found it. Many pirates are superstitious or consider sacred ground^off limits so would not dare rob graveyards but you have no such qualms about searching the quiet and peaceful burial sites for whatever the dead could not^take with them.
qstr_Pirates_love_guns_fo|Pirates love guns, for both long range and short range combat and you worked for the largest gunsmith in town.^You learnt how to build and clean top quality pistols and rifles and also had alot of practice in how to use them.
qstr_Piracy_is_a_bloody_a|Piracy is a bloody and brutal line of work and when a battle commences it is not long before the cries of the wounded are calling out^for the medic. You were trained well enough in wound treatment and basic surgery and you would run in and amongst the fighting on board to drag the wounded to safety^and hopefully patch them up to see another day.
qstr_You_taught_yourself_|You taught yourself how to use a sword during your teenage years and you wished to one day own your own ship and^lead a crew around the open seas. In order to earn money to save towards this goal you became a mercenary for whoever was looking to hire you.^You didn't care about the whose and the whys, just how much. You never managed to save up enough for the ship though as you got robbed by wily^female pirate while you were having a steam bath.
qstr_You_were_captured_by|You were captured by Dark Elf corsairs when you were 12 and sold as a slave to work in Kraken and then when you were strong enough^to work on a galleon rowing the oars. You were subjected to this hard life until you were 23 when the ship you were on was successfully taken by an attacking pirate^fleet. You were rescued and freed by the captain who recognising your accent knew you were one of them and you started a new life from then on.
qstr_Your_job_was_to_gath|Your job was to gather food and furs for your tribe. You hunted all animals including boar, wolves, bears and when^you were feeling particularly bold sabre tooth tiger. You had to be very precise in both the hunt and the cut, if you messed up the skinning then your^furs would be rejected in favour of someone else and you would go out of pocket.
qstr_You_loved_the_viciou|You loved the vicious and brutal arena of a blood bowl pitch. You joined the local blood bowl team and^although you rarely won you didn't care. You didn't play to get the ball over the line, you just wanted to crush the opposition and send^as many to the apothecary as possible.
qstr_Chaos_love_raiding_t|Chaos love raiding the Empire because the Empire took the land which were rightfully theirs when they became^a superpower in the main continent. Though proud and mighty the warriors from the north are just not large enough to face the full might of the Empire and their machines^of war and win. So rather than one all out war they like to raid and pillage when they can and try to impose economic woes on the Empire of Sigmar. Your^job was to scout the Empire borderland for merchant parties and important convoys and also to learn when villages get supplies in and run back to alert^the raiding parties.
qstr_There_were_many_road|There were many roads available to you but you were set on becoming a warrior of global renown.^You wanted a revelation, an intervention from your God to bless you and endow you with the power needed to achieve your ambition.^You wandered through the far north for years and finally your God answered and you came back from the mountains^a new man.
qstr_Although_nowhere_nea|Although nowhere near as skilled in a fight you managed to join the reavers while you were young on a favour^and you scoured the seas and coastlines looking for slaves to sell on to other nations. You are no stranger to boarding other ships and loved^nothing more than a highly charged skirmish with the pirates.
qstr_Marauders_do_not_hav|Marauders do not have a lot of armour compared to a lot of other armies but they do like to use shields although the quality^of shields is usually low. You wanted to make a point of producing quality shields for the army so you learnt from a Norse dwarf exactly what needs^to be done to make a solid shield. He also taught you how to defend yourself effectively with one as well.
qstr_You_joined_the_local_|You joined the local blood bowl team and had 3 wildly successful seasons. Your team was lightening fast and very tough.^You mastered the art of protecting your skinks and your kroxigor always came out on top in the epic centre scrum battles. You spotted all opposition looking^to send the skinks to the apothecary and got in their faces forcing them to deal with you instead. They always ended second best.
qstr_Unlike_the_Dark_Elve|Unlike the Dark Elves who have to trick cold ones into being their mount the Lizardmen have a bond with the species^which dwell in Lustria and they will usually serve the Saurus' freely. With the many wars the Lizardmen always have to fight it is important that^there is enough cavalry for all fronts so you herded them into packs ready for service.
qstr_Lizardman_weapons_ar|Lizardman weapons are probably the most unique in the whole of the world. No other races weapons look or inflict damage in quite the same way.^The weapons tend to tear chunks out of their prey rather than a clean slice and the force behind them often winds the enemy at the same time as penetrating through their armour and flesh.^You worked as smith making the weapons en masse for the army.
qstr_You_knew_that_the_ba|You knew that the battlefield and war was your destiny, it is the destiny of every saurus but you took some time to devout yourself to your religion and^to the God Sotek. You pilgrimaged to sacred sites and listened to and learnt from the many priests who live in the sacred temples. You learnt of the past and the prophecies^of the future and why it is so important to defend your homeland from those that would desecrate the sanctity of your holy sites.
qstr_Lustrian_towns_hold_|Lustrian towns hold tournaments like other races and you respect the tradition and as master you make sure the event runs smoothly but your main duty^at other times was to see that the hundreds of saurus warriors keep in practice and learn how to fight as quickly as possible. Young and inexperienced saurus' would come to you the^arena school as pre-military training and you had a bruising routine you say all troops complere before you sent them on.
qstr_You_served_your_cast|You served your castles Lord for 4 years, making sure that his every wish is followed through and that everyone down the information^chain is up to speed and working towards the Lord's desires. You made a point of being a step ahead of all the political and military situations of the Lizardman^kingdom so you were never at a loss or stuck for an answer when your Lord enquired about a situation.
qstr_The_biggest_and_stro|The biggest and strongest rules over the others, this is the base principle of orc society, and the only way to become <<da biggas an da strongas>> is to win and fight against the other aspirant chiefs. But only one in the tribe managed to become <<da Boss>> and that was you.    You fought a lot, won a lot, grew a lot, to the point that no one even dared to challenge your fearsome authority fearing your savage reprisal. Still, your glory days as a leader ended when you left your tribe all on your own, because of..
qstr_The_ways_of_Gork_and|The ways of Gork and Mork are mysterious, but not for you. You heard their unison voices whispering inside your mind since the beginning, guiding you toward the accomplishment of higher goals . Thus you carved the face of the Twin Gods on the side of a mountain, a sign for all the greenskins to see.   They came to you, entire WAAAGHs, to hear Their word.<<Da prophet>> they called you, religious pillar, mouth of the gods. Yet, the Gods had other plans for you, so they forced to leave your people with the induced false conviction of..
qstr_Everyone_likes_to_we|Everyone likes to wear some <<ard bitz>> or to wield a <<propa dead killy choppa>>, but in order to get them you first need to craft them. You chose that as your job. As the WAAAGHtermaster, you spent your days in the smoke-smelling darkness of your camps crude smithy tent, smelting and re-forging the fallen enemies gears into <<orc stuff>> and occasionally kicking your lazy goblin servants backends when they didnt work fast enough for your standards. Though, the life in the smithy soon became too boring for you, so you left because of..
qstr_The_greenskins_econo|The greenskins economical system is a quite unique one, using <<teeffs>> as money. Given the high chance of a violent fight happening multiple times a day inside of a standard greenskin community and the extraordinary rate at which the greenskins teeth regrow, a common drunken brawl can turn into an opencast bank. By staying out of the core of the fights and sneaking between the flying fists of your fellows, day by day, you started amassing an ever growing quantity of fangs.   Was it an honourable behavior? <<Who carez!>> your quick answer. Loaded with your riches, one day you left your camp because of...
qstr_Orcs_love_dwarf_tunn|Orcs love dwarf tunnels, but do hate the dwarfs inhabiting them. As a tunnel dweller you learned how to properly fight and defend yourself in cramped spaces, how to focus your sight in the dark and sharpened your sense of direction, a most vital skill when navigating inside the belly of the mountains. But you werent aware of your instinct driven advanced training, you just wanted <<ta chop down da bloody stumpy dworfz!>> to take all <<da shiny stuff>> they carried. Still, at one point you decided to stop your activities in the underground because of..
qstr_Pirates_are_a_quite_|Pirates are a quite common threat for the sea-travelling merchants and explorers but a crew of pirate orcs is definitely something more than a simple threat.   << YAHHR WAAAGH! Filthy runts, hand me da gubbinz AN prepare ta get wreckd!>>. Diplomacy has never been your strong suit. Still, results are results, and your all personal kind of diplomacy was both really rewarding and entertaining. Leading your mates over the waves, sailing on a miraculously-not-yet-sunken raft, that you proudly baptised <<Da Flyin Greenskin>> , swashbuckling hard and true, it looked all so natural and fun to you until one day you decide the pirates life was not for you, leaving your life as a pirate behind because of..
qstr_When_the_tribe_reuni|When the tribe reunites under the liege of a single goblins rugged banner, strange forces develop from the twisted and obtuse ideas buzzing inside the thousands of hundreds green heads.\ Your task then was to harness <<da powa ov da zmall WAAAGH!>> and translate it into the will of the Twin Gods, Mork and Gork. And brew fungus beer, else no goblin would ever dare to fight without a bit of that powerful rage inducing drug. Your important role made you rise at the top of your tribes hierarchy, but from great powers come great explosion like the one that accidentally decimated your WAAAGH! right before a battle after you miscast a spell. Fleeing from what little remained alive of your ex subjects, you found safety in an hollow tree stump, where you hid for quite some time
qstr_You_were_in_the_serv|You were in the service of a group of shamans and they specialised in making potions and balms made with all kinds^of experimental stimulants and hallucinogens. At first you did it for gold, then you did it for free and when your addiction for these colourful bottles^and vials reached it's paramount the shaman's managed to get you to pay for the privilege. They had many strange effects on you over the years and you^were only released from their grip when the shaman were killed in an explosion causes by one of their mixtures going out of control.^It was hell on the Old World trying to live without the drugs but you made it through in the end.
qstr_You_offered_your_ser|You offered your service to the greenskin flying corp and became one of the winged wonders of the Old World.^On the battlefield you were launched into the air with a catapult and were then supposed to kamikaze yourself into an enemy of distinction, killing you^both. You loved your job, souring high above the battlefield, seeing for miles and miles, you once yanked the beard of a gyrocopter pilot mid flight. The^only thing was that you never kept up your end of the bargain. You seemed to be made of such strong stuff that you always survived the dive, often with broken^bones and bruises but you always lived to fly another day.
qstr_Fast._Dodge_a_couple|Fast. Dodge a couple blunderbass shots. Leap over a dead goblin, <<stoopid git>> you tell to yourself while running. There is a dwarf running at you, his axe and armor shining at the light of the fires. A doom diver flies screaming over your head as you keep running. It splashes into the dwarfs chest. The way is clear, keep running. There is your objective, you see him, a white haired dwarf with some strange clothes.^ Is he wearing machinery? {Shiny! Me like dat kinda dorfz stuff}. He has not seen you yet. The dwarf engineer was so busy working over his artillery piece that all he saw was a screeching thing dressed in ragged cloth jumping at him. The last thing the doomed dwarf saw was the things crude knife about to cut his throat. Then he was no more.
qstr_The_great_steppes_of|The great steppes of the east, like the desertic Badlands, are the dwelling and hunting grounds of great goblin tribes, feared for their peculiar tradition of taming and riding wolves into battle. A true scourge to any caravaneer or adventurer brave enough to traverse those wild lands. But you never cared for the opinion of those you mercilessly slew, all you were always hungry for was riding fazt and all da precious loot you could gather after the fight.^ Always cheerful when the time for ambushing another unsuspecting caravan trail came nigh, always ready to sign their ends with green letters.
qstr_A_goblin_with_someth|A goblin with something resembling an actual working brain? Impossible. Yet you exist. A truly amazing green snowflake. Tired of the simplicity of your fellows minds and the utter stupidity of that snotling they called boss, you used your advanced intelligence to plan your rise to power.^ It did not take you long to organize a wide-spread mutiny in your tribe, after you began throwing around voices like {Da boss iz a dorfs friend} or the most insulting {Me saw da boss kissin a squig}, and of course, when the fighting calmed down, you were crowned the hero of the rebellion and the new leader. Unfortunately, the higher you rise the harder you will fall, and you fell when a rival of yours released a pack of squigs inside your quarters. Fleeing for your life under your tribes eyes, you offered them a quite solid reason for your forced demotion.
qstr_Other_nations_loved_|Other nations loved to do trading with the High Elves due to the quality of their products and some of the fine resources which are to be^found on Ulthuan so a High Elf town is often full of foreign merchants looking to buy, sell and barter for their living. You worked as the guildmaster of Tor Achare for 4^years which was a very demanding job.
qstr_You_always_liked_blo|You always liked blood bowl and often watched it being played but you never thought you would end up playing for your local team but you^did after your pride was wounded by some Dwarven scouts who were investigating the High Elf teams. They said that speed and agility will never beat strength and brutality^and that the High Elf teams were destined for mediocrity. You took it upon yourself to train and lead your team to a trophy which you never managed to do but you did beat the^best Dwarven team in the league in their own ground which was a massive success and one up against the scouts.
qstr_Elves_often_say_that|Elves often say that the underground is meant for the Dwarves but you were always inspired by the stories you used to hear about famous groups of warriors^who go searching the dungeons of the world for treasures and mighty forgotten foes. You were surprised to learn how many Elves took part in these adventure parties as they are not spoken^about in your homelands. You decided to find and join a low key but brave adventure party near the Norselands to get a taste of what it was like.
qstr_You_joined_the_infam|You joined the infamous ranks of the Elven archers who are mainstay of the Elven forces and rain deadly showers of arrows on their enemies. Although the unit you^joined is one of the lowest in the army it was still very hard to qualify as the standard demanded is so high and they are tested twice a week for clarity.
qstr_Elven_horses_are_fam|Elven horses are famous for the purity of their breed and even though the best Arabian horses can claim to be nearly as fast they are nowhere near as strong nor have the same^stamina at high speed as the horses which are bred on the fields of Ellyrion. You worked on as part of a horse training community in the fields making sure that the hundreds of horses you^bred for the army where of the absolute best quality and the best shape for war both to protect the rider and itself.
qstr_The_Elves_are_not_bi|The Elves are not big users of war machines but they do make good use of their repeater bolt throwers which can literally tear the^units of large beasts often found in opposing armies to pieces. You learnt the mechanics and physics of all the variations as well as the few high class siege equipment^in the army so that you can help your crew mates use them as quickly and efficiently as possible.
qstr_You_spent_2_years_st|You spent 2 years studying the anatomy of all the races so you could learn the most brutal and most effective ways of torturing them.^Afterwards you were assigned to the towers of Hag Graef where you were tasked with torturing the more high profile prisoners or those with the most vital information.
qstr_You_became_intereste|You became interested in blood bowl at a time when Dark Elves teams were dominating all the major cup competitions. You practiced for^years and ended up being signed as a line elf in one of the best up and coming teams in Naggarond. You began on a high as you helped your team win the Orc Toof Cup^but as the honours stacked up by all the Dark Elf wins so did the pressure at home and you were eventually dropped in favour of a witch Elf. Any other time and you^would have been good enough but you happened to play at the time of a golden generation and your dream ended before it really began.
qstr_You_did_not_have_the|You did not have the talents to become a corsair but you wanted to be a part of their crew and share in their successes. You know how to handle a ship^and are an excellent navigator which is a vital skill for the corsairs as the distance from Naggaroth to their target areas are usually of extreme length.^You ended up being transferred to the ship of a Dark Elf lord who pulled rank for your talents and you spent 8 years in a relentless war with Chaos.
qstr_You_bought_the_fines|You bought the finest dark steed you could find and worked as a herald for the army field marshall. You acted as a scout ahead of the army to track down^enemy hosts and before battle you were sent to parley with your opposite number and reject any plea for peace or terms of surrender that were presented to you. If any message needed to be sent between^allied armies or diplomatic figures of the other races then you were usually sent for.
qstr_While_you_thrive_in_|While you thrive in the thick of battle like all Dark Elves you also love organised fighting and competitive tournaments which often take place in the Old World.^You worked as an arena master where your day to day task was to organise and run the fighting school routine and make sure that all new combatents get the sternest test possible. Sometimes^a major tournament will be held in your town and you got to work alongside your lord in creating a prestigious and exciting tournament which will be remember for a long time.
qstr_You_grew_up_with_gre|You grew up with great admiration of the dread knights and your family was well born and connected so you managed to get assigned as an apprentice to^a prestigious dread knight. You followed him during campaigns making sure his every need was taken care of, that his weapons, armour and cold one were always in the best condition possible^and you learnt a great deal about how to be a successful rider and how to be just as tough as the cold one you are riding.
qstr_You_earnt_yourself_a|You earnt yourself a contract with the famous Dwarf giants as a blitzer playing on the inside right wing.^You loved the sheer brutality of the league and when a team is as slow as a Dwarven team you had to be as brutal as possible and create^a stone wall for your opponents to get past and make it as impenetrable as possible. You were praised for your bravery against opposing star^players and your skills in guard, tackle and mighty blow.
qstr_You_trained_as_a_tat|You trained as a tattoo artist specialising in slayer tattoos and specifically tattoos which make the slayer more tough and durable.^You knew that slayers are seeking death and want to be taken in an epic duel but after seeing how key the slayers are in Dwarf military victories you decided to^covertly help keep them alive.
qstr_Although_some_of_you|Although some of your family frowned upon them you always admired the great thunderer units in the Dwarven army and aspired to be as skilled as they^are with a handgun when you were an adult. You trained yourself to be a keen eyed sniper with a small but well made gun you found in a barrel one day. You started off^using things such as tankards and rats and as targets but after a Lord saw you practicing he hired you to use hand picked live targets instead, discreetly and for a price of course.
qstr_In_the_tight_tunnels|In the tight tunnels of the mountains even a small number of dwarves can make an impenetrable wall with a mixture of good defensive fighting^and strong shields. Shields are something of a Dwarven speciality and you worked in a shieldsmith making shields from reinforced wood to the finest cuts of bronze and gold.
qstr_You_served_as_an_anv|You served as an anvil guard protecting a rune lord  You were meant to protect but in fact the magic of the anvil saved you from more incoming arrows^than times you saved the runelord from incoming units. You served your Lord faithfully and with honour and when he died of old age you were free to pursue a new direction.
qstr_You_served_your_castl|You served your castles Lord for 4 years, making sure that his every wish is followed through and that everyone down the information^chain is up to speed and working towards the Lord's desires. You made a point of being a step ahead of all the political and military situations of the Dwarven^kingdom so you were never at a loss or stuck for an answer when your Lord enquired about a situation.
qstr_Clan_Eshin_as_well_a|Clan Eshin as well as many lords you know love to cover their weapons in deadly poison before they head into battle and^if you know how to make the most potent poisons then it can be a very lucrative business. You stole the recipe for an extremely lethal poison from^a priest and passed it off as your own. Very soon your name was one of the first on the lips^of those who only liked to use the best which money could buy. You became very rich and you paid a top assassin to terminate the priest when he started speaking up.
qstr_The_Skaven_excel_in_|The Skaven excel in making firearms, their technology is even more advanced than the Dwarves and they even manage to use the power^of the warpstone to make the weapon even more powerful. Their crown jewel of the massed produced guns is the Jezzail which has been known to pierce Imperial tanks^with a good shot. You spent your time making and testing them for clan Skyre.
qstr_Traditional_skaven_s|Traditional skaven strategy on the battlefield is to throw as many rats forward as possible and sooner or later the enemy will be overwhelmed.^This is often successful but the casualties taken by the rank and file are enormous so the main army need as many recruits as possible but not all Skaven are willing to join the^army. You were part of a team assembled by the council to bully and browbeat clan rats into joining up, making their lives hell until they submitted and gave up whatever other^ambition they had.
qstr_You_were_part_of_the|You were part of the ratogre breeding scheme which is a combination of twisted genetics and unimaginable suffering. Most tend to die before maturity but^the ones which survive are usually blood thirsty killers and completely reliant on you to direct them. You also bred and controlled giant rat swarms which were used more in dungeons and^the tunnelling system than on the battlefield.
qstr_You_were_trained_rig|You were trained rigorously by a master of clan Eshin, specialising in the light and quick weapons which they favoured. Kill quick and move on^was the piece of advice that was pressed upon you time and time again. Of all the weapons your favourite to practice with was throwing stars, they are so unexpected yet so deadly.^You spent months learning to throw harder and more accurate until you could hold your own against the professional army recruits.
qstr_With_treachery_and_b|With treachery and betrayal rife in the Skaven underworld it was a tough proposition being a lord. Being in charge of thousands of^Skaven just meant their were thousands of vermin waiting to stab you in the back. You had to be ahead of the game in every way and that is why you were hired^as a sensechal. To hear every whisper, to see every trick and to make sure you miss nothing which could compromise the Lord's position. You knew the lord did not^trust you and you did not trust him but you did your job faithfully enough and did him no wrong, apart from pilfering as much money from his accounts as you could.
qstr_With_the_passing_of_|With the passing of time, the ancient blood of Neferata, the first of all the vampires, visibly changed you. That aeons old curse flowing in your veins had turned your skin pale, your face in a contorted grin, your eyes into empty holes of nothingness. But together with these external changes came many new ambitions and dreams. Dreams of dominance, that slowly crept in your mind, as the ravenous lust for conquest overtook your almost vanished soul.^You knew you were going to leave your mark upon this world, but you still had to deal with your life, until one day you left it all behind because of....
qstr_With_the_passing_of_t|With the passing of time, the ancient blood of Neferata, the first of all the vampires, visibly changed you. That aeons old curse flowing in your veins had turned your skin pale, your face in a contorted grin, your eyes into empty holes of nothingness. What you have always known as a legend, a story to scare the children with during the stormy nights, revealed itself to be true. The Blood Knights, once an order of noble questing paladins turned into vampires by an unknown traitor, were real and were still alive. It was your own blood telling you this, knowing how fascinated you were by their myth. So, you swore to yourself you were going to become one of them one, but you still had to deal with your life, until one day you left it all behind because of....
qstr_With_the_passing_of_ti|With the passing of time, the ancient blood of Neferata, the first of all the vampires, visibly changed you. That aeons old curse flowing in your veins had turned your skin pale, your face in a contorted grin, your eyes into empty holes of nothingness. You never left your master's side since he gave you the Blood Kiss. You grew more and more able in the vampire ways under his guidance, rewarding his protection and teachings with your servile obedience. That went on until your transformation was complete, and as a full grown vampire you left your lord's castle because of...
qstr_With_the_passing_of_tim|With the passing of time, the ancient blood of Neferata, the first of all the vampires, visibly changed you. That aeons old curse flowing in your veins had turned your skin pale, your face in a contorted grin, your eyes into empty holes of nothingness. Soon you found out that your thirst for blood wasn't the only new instinct brought by the obscure ritual. The trespassing of the liminal concepts of life and death has awaken a deep lust for knowledge in your broken mind. But what you sought wasn't surely the common kind of notions, taught in schools or academies through all the Empire. You searched for the tools able to change the rules of existance: necromancy. So one day you set off on your road, ready to walk your path, because of...
qstr_With_the_passing_of_time|With the passing of time, the ancient blood of Neferata, the first of all the vampires, visibly changed you. That aeons old curse flowing in your veins had turned your skin pale, your face in a contorted grin, your eyes into empty holes of nothingness. But what is immortality if not a distinct sign of superiority over the rest of the pitiful mortals? With your soul shattered and every trace of pity or remorse wiped away by the black vampiric blood, you slowly adventured down the path of destruction and enslavement your self-appointed superior status demanded for. All was to be yours or be ready to face annihilation by your unholy hand, sworn to carry your bloody crusade across the whole world. Only you knew what first drove you away from your previous life...
qstr_With_the_passing_of_time_|With the passing of time, the ancient blood of Neferata, the first of all the vampires, visibly changed you. That aeons old curse flowing in your veins had turned your skin pale, your face in a contorted grin, your eyes into empty holes of nothingness. If dreadful visions and strange voices whispering to you were your companions of a lifetime, that strange happening has been the last straw that broke your already stumbling psyche. Too much, too much power had fallen into your hands and you've been crushed by it. You escaped reality to enter your personal demented dimension. You became a monster, a beast, a stalker always ready to fall upon his preys. Strange rumors rose about a creature haunting the outskirts of Sylvania, brutally murdering and eating those foolish enough to tread alone in those misty dead lands.^ But even the maddest knows that there are bigger things achievable when you are holding such a great power and time hasn't a meaning anymore. Your mind rationalised that change in your aims as....
qstr_The_seeker_of_knowle|The seeker of knowledge, keeper of wisdom and magic. Your worship for him has always been quite natural, given your great interest for everything mysterious and new, which persisted even after you moved to Athel Loren, far away from his cults center: the White Tower of Hoeth. And so, you kept on studying the mystic ways of nature under his benevolent sight, until one day you felt the urge to leave, because of...
qstr_Mother_of_all_elves_|Mother of all elves, goddess of harvest and fertility, wife of Kurnous. Your faith in Isha got stronger since your arrival in the magic forest. Her presence became manifest to your eyes under the form of your queen Ariel, granting you the ultimate sign of her love for her sons and daughters. Many aspects of her divinity reflecting in your behaviours, as you always cared for your brothers and sisters and strived for their good. Your caring leader nature brought you to leave your place to bring the Mothers holy aid where needed, but the apparent reason was...
qstr_The_divine_blacksmit|The divine blacksmith, the crippled forgemaster. Wood elves always worshipped Vaul as one of their major deities, specially in the realm of Torgovann, where you lived, as the ruler Lord Daith was believed to be the incarnation of the god himself. Your creativity and innate manual skills, honed by the teachings of the torgovanni blacksmiths, made you feel closer to Vaul himself to the point of hearing the gods voice every time the hammer fell on the iron. With the heat of the forge burning in your heart, one day you left your home, because of...
qstr_Goddess_of_dreams_pr|Goddess of dreams, prophecy and fortune, she is mostly worshipped by bretonnians, who know her by the name of Lady of the Lake, but even in Athel Loren her worship is still present among those who came from Ulthuan, and you are the proof. Praying for her blessing to be given onto you for all your life, you received the gift of farsight, making your eyes capable of perfectly seeing through distance and time itself. With your new gift, you set out to become an adventurer because of...
qstr_The_trickster_the_la|The trickster, the laughing god of vengeance.  As one of the secretive worshippers of this ambiguous divinity, you spent your times lurking in the shadows, ready to fall upon the enemies who dared to threaten your home. Swifter than wind, your blade was always ready to taste the blood of your  victims in the macabre and majestic dance of death your moves created.  The forces of evil are relentless, though. So you had to part ways with your people to take on the twisted holy path of your god, justifying your improvise decision as being all because of...
qstr_Dark_goddess_of_brut|Dark goddess of brutal hunting and vengeance, sister of Khaela Mensha Khaine the Lord of Murder. As a divinity exiled from the pantheon of the elves allied with the forces of order, you had to keep worshipping her in a secret realm located deep in the darkest parts of the ancient forest. Her blessing granted you a savage thirst for stalking and killing your preys, a gift that you concealed to your family and friends, knowing that if they were ever to find you tainted by her dark rage, death was going to be the sentence on your head. So the lust for the hunt grew stronger and stronger into your soul, until one day you had to leave it all to follow your goddesses feral path. To whomever asked it, you said you left because of...
qstr_The_travel_surely_ch|The travel surely changed you, though you are not sure if it has been for better or worse. As a matter of fact, you began to think about yourself as a too important individual to stay under other rulers, and so you fueled a rebellion. The bloodbath was great almost as the failure of such a daring act. When you were captured, the High Prophets decided for a punishment more fit for such a strong warrior as you: serving as an officer in the penitent Infernal Legion. Battle after battle, you served your time in the Legion and were readmitted into society, stripped of all your previous titles and honors. After living as a normal citizen for some time though, you decided to leave, because of...
qstr_All_the_experiences_|All the experiences accumulated during the long journey and your previous life in the Darklands finally gave their fruits, as you were finally allowed to carry the title of Daemonsmith. As one of the most influent persons in the new colonial empire of the Dawi Zharr, you ruled with an iron fist, willing to sacrifice everything to empower your craft and art and to please the Father of Darkness with every strike of your hammer. Although, many were the ones not pleased by your atrocious tyranny, so one night a band of warriors stormed your arcane forge as you were working in it, seeking to kill you. Yet, you managed to flee and keep living, after you changed your name. With time, most forgot about you, becoming nothing more than a tale, a tale that told how you left because of...
qstr_Through_learning_dev|Through learning, devotion and placing the right bribes where it was needed, you finally managed to enter in the retinue of a Prophet of Hashut, one of the high lords of the Chaos Dwarfs, as one of his personal attendants. Arcane rituals, sacrifices, public games, you witnessed them all, leeching knowledge from the actions and practices of your master, and extrapolating precious lessons from the pains of others. You drank the malevolent essence of Hashut, the Father of Darkness, until it became a drug to you and made you wanting for more and more. So, you decided to leave the safety of the great obsidian temple city to find the forbidden knowledge that will turn you into the most powerful sorcerer of your race. To keep your true goals secret, you lied about your reasons to leave, saying that it was all because of...
qstr_Liquid_fire_and_molt|Liquid fire and molten metal flow incessantly in the bowels of the great industrial furnaces of the black cities of the Chaos Dwarfs, as if that boiling incandescence alone kept them from crumbling and withering. After the settlement in the new lands, you found your new place in the society as one of the few knowledgeable enough to make the huge forges work and make them produce the dreaded artillery guns, armors and weapons of the Dawi Zharr armies. It was not long before your crafts became famous amongst the folks of your city, with many requesting to buy your master crafted creations. One day though, your fortune ended abruptly when another blacksmith started selling better gear than yours. So, after some time, you left your city because of...
qstr_The_great_temple_cit|The great temple cities of the Chaos Dwarfs are dark places of vice and horror, where the pleasure and relief is given by what most would address as abominable and heretical practices. One of those activities is of course attending to the many organized battles among the slaves. As a lord of the shallow prisons where the gladiator slaves dwell, the pits, your almost holy duty was to train and choose the most aggressive fighters among them, so they could put up a great show when slaughtering their unfortunate weaker fellows in the arena. Until one day, during one of the arena events, the impossible happened. One of your most famous champions got killed by one of the appointed victims. Demoted for your failure, you tried living as a normal citizen, until one day you decided to leave it all, because of...
qstr_The_arrival_in_the_l|The arrival in the lands of Albion marked the end of the quest Hashut gave the Chaos Dwarfs, though not all of them were keen on settling and building a new empire there. You, for instance, saw the new lands as a new opportunity to satiate your greed. The hunt for greater fortunes and riches, the evil game of raiding and plundering villages and farms, the scent of iron emanated by the blood drenching the blade of your axe, this is all you wanted after the long and dangerous travel to reach these foreign lands. And so you set out with few others, and for years you became one of the most feared outlaws that roamed the coasts of Bretonnia. Your lucky streak of raids though found its end one day, when after landing with your small warband, you were ambushed by the soldiers of King Leoncoeur. Returning to your city, you stayed there for a while, but then you decided to leave because of...
qstr_Blood_for_the_blood_|Blood for the blood God. Your frenzied passion for slaughter is only equalled by your devotion to the most powerful God of them all, the God of hate and destruction.
qstr_Your_vision_of_life_|Your vision of life is one of hedonism and excess. You share the pleasures of slaanesh and live a life of raping, pillaging and enslaving the human villages on the fringes of the Empire.
qstr_The_Bretonnian_court|The Bretonnian court refers to the Beastman conquest of Estalia as 'The great disease' and as far as you are concerned this just means your race is succeeding in its mission to destroy the body and minds of mankind. You worship nurgle, the God of pestilence and corruption who feeds from the hopelessness of the weaker races. The beastman are a plague upon mankind and this plague will be their undoing.
qstr_Your_whole_life_you_|Your whole life you have lived by the idea that if you want something you take it. I have a great ambition and belief that your destiny is to rise to the top of the herd and lead the great armies to ultimate victory over the lands of men, elves and dwarves. With your power and the power of your God tzeentch it is only a matter of time before the whole world falls into ruins before you.
qstr_A_cooking_pot_is_lik|A cooking pot is like an extension of yourself and your knowledge of herbs, spices and cooking techniques is unsurpassed on your street. You could make a stew out of anything but in truth you are a fussy eater and only want to eat the finest of ingredients.
qstr_Your_mother_always_t|Your mother always taught you the value of healthy food and it was a lesson which stuck with you as you grew up. You even learnt to catch your own fish and would often spend up to 12 hours perched by the pier hoping to catch a 4 footer.
qstr_The_meatier_the_juic|The meatier, the juicier and the messier the better. Rarely did you come home from an evening out dining with a clean shirt but always with a bloated and satisfied belly.
qstr_You_love_to_gorge_al|You love to gorge all day long on cheese, pate, sausages, goose, Estalian luncheon meats, you loved it all and the more the merrier.
qstr_You_didn_t_have_much|You didn't have much time for the kitchen. You liked to spend your days drinking in all of the inns and taverns within the boundaries of the moot and even on occassion in the great Imperial drinking halls.
qstr_You_have_an_exceptio|You have an exceptional voice and know hundreds of classic songs off by heart. You are a wanted man across all the drinking establishments of the moot and you even get hired by the Imperial elite to sing at weddings and funerals.
qstr_Hounds_are_great_fri|Hounds are great friends of halflings and make fantastic steeds. They are steadier platforms for horse archery than rams and better at dodging out of the way of incoming infantry. You trained them how to perform in battle and how to remain fearless in the face of the many horrors which the halflings can face from the Sylvanian territories.
qstr_The_renowned_archers|The renowned archers of the halfling army require an enormous amount of equipment and ammunition both for training and for the wars in which they are hired to fight. You worked in a team of 30 in the largest fletcher outside of the forest of Loren.
qstr_You_worked_in_an_ext|You worked in an extremely high pressure environment under the rudest and most impatient heade chef in the moot. He would bellow red faced commands and scream and shout if any dish was less than perfect or over a second late to the table. You worked yourself to the bone and cheered in delight when your time in the kitchen was finally over.
qstr_The_night_goblin_rai|The night goblin raids have increased within the mootlands to an almost intolerable level. No one could ignore it however much they wanted to so you did what any brave halfling would do and signed up for 2 years in the militia protecting the southern mootland.
qstr_Vampires_to_the_nort|Vampires to the north, orcs to the east, goblins to the south and highwaymen to the east. There is so much potential danger out there and if the halflings were to defend themselves efficiently then they had to be fast and organised. You were a scout for the militia and rode your hound around the outskirts of halfling territory. If you saw any signs of danger you raced to one of the linked alarm points so that the militia and rangers can help defend the locals from the intruders.
qstr_Your_raiding_party_w|Your raiding party was ambushed by a patrol near the Empire/Bretonnia border but the tide of battle turned very quickly and soon the entire regiment was killed. So enraged by the attack you drunk every body dry of blood and hung their bodies on trees for all to see.
qstr_When_you_were_young_|When you were young you overheard a group of campers claiming that Orcs were the worst archers in the world,^even worse than Goblins. This insult stuck with you and you spent your youth training hard with the long bow so that you can prove them wrong.
qstr_You_were_raiding_an_|You were raiding an area just south of the river Brienne when you came across a Bretonnian princess in a private carriage. Her guard were taken out by a group of spear throwers and then you knocked over the carriage, dragged her out by her hair and smashed her head on a rock 12 times. You left her blood stained body on top of the rock and fled before the onrushing unit of questing knights could catch you. They screamed their cries of vengeance but could not stop you retreating to deep forest.
qstr_Your_flatulence_is_s|Your flatulence is so strong that any tree or plant which is touched by your putrid gas will wither and die within a day. Many pestigors believe it is because you are favoured by nurgle and very quickly they started to follow you around as their leader. You used this power to your advantage to move higher and higher up the hierachy until the High Elves annihilated your army in a bloody coastal battle. Only 6 of you survived that day and the Elves have held the beach ever since.
qstr_The_beastmen_will_of|The beastmen will often perform shows of strength and power by engaging in headbutt and horn locking contests. They don't hold the same reputation as the fights to the death which frequently occur in the herd but you have never lost a contest and it has given you some status within the ranks.
qstr_Even_though_the_magi|Even though the magic of the bray shaman has made razorgors more susceptible to lone riders they are still a dangerous beast to tame, even for the mightyl beastmen. It takes tactics as well as strength and it came to you as second nature and before long you were hired by a beastlord to tame enough razorgors for 3 battalions of thunderhoofs.
qstr_Only_you_know_exactl|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.^Still, it was not a difficult choice to leave, with the rage burning brightly in your heart.^You want vengeance. You want justice. What was done to you cannot be undone,^and these debts can only be paid in blood...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.^All you can say is that you couldn't bear to stay, not with the memories of those you loved so close and so painful.^ Perhaps your new life will let you forget, or honour the name that you can no longer bear to speak...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.^You're not even sure when your home became a prison, when the familiar became mundane, but your dreams of^wandering have taken over your life. Whether you yearn for some faraway place or merely for the open road and the^freedom to travel, you could no longer bear to stay in the same place. You simply went and never looked back...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_w|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.^It was so unlike you, what changed? Are you going crazy? have you lost your ability to reason? Or maybe, just maybe the old man was right, and your destiny^was to go down in history as one of the greatest leaders of the age. You never listened to men like this before but something captured you and you felt^compelled to change your life direction. Only time will tell if it was for nothing.
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_wh|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.^However, you know you cannot go back. There's nothing to go back to. Whatever home you may have had is gone^now, and you must face the fact that you're out in the wide wide world. Alone to sink or swim...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_wha|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.^To everyone else, it's clear that you're now motivated solely by personal gain.^You want to be rich, powerful, respected, feared.^You want to be the one whom others hurry to obey.^You want people to know your name, and tremble whenever it is spoken.^You want everything, and you won't let anyone stop you from having it...
qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_what|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.^You never thought you would be a bold and aggressive leader but the murder of your brother on your doorstep, killed a drunken noble for being from an insignificant family, changed your life forever.^As he lie in your arms he made you swear to make something of the family name, so that everyone will know your name and fear. You swore a blood oath and rode hard and fast for the Old World.
